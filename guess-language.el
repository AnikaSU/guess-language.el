;;; Commentary:

;; Just a proof of concept at this time.  Only supports English and
;; German but can easily be extended to handle other languages.

;; The detection algorithm is based on counts of character
;; trigrams.  The trigrams are copied from guess_language.py
;; (https://github.com/kent37/guess-language).
