;;; Commentary:

;; Guess-language is a buffer-local minor mode.  It guesses the
;; language of the current paragraph when flyspell detects an
;; incorrect word and changes ispell's dictionary and typo-mode
;; accordingly.  If the language settings change, flyspell is rerun
;; but only on the current paragraph.  Guess-language thus supports
;; documents using multiple languages.  If the paragraph is shorter
;; than some user-defined value, none of the above happens because
;; there is likely not enough text to guess the language correctly.
;;
;; The detection algorithm is based on counts of character
;; trigrams.  At this time, supported languages are Czech, Dansk,
;; Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Italian, Norwegian,
;; Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Slovak, Slovenian, Swedish.  Adding
;; further languages is very easy and this package already contains
;; language statistics for 49 additional languages.
