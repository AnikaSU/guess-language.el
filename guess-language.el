;;; Commentary:

;; At this time, supported languages are English, French,
;; German.  Adding more languages is easy though.  The detection
;; algorithm is based on counts of character trigrams.

Guess-language mode is a buffer-local minor mode.  When enabled,
it guesses the language when flyspell detects words that are
incorrectly and changes the ispell's dictionary and typo-mode
accordingly.  If the language settings change, flyspell is run on
the current paragraph.  If the paragraph is shorter than
`guess-language-min-paragraph-length' none of the above happens
because there is likely not enough text to guess the language
